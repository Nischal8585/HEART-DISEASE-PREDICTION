OVERVIEW
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict heart disease based on various medical and demographic attributes. By leveraging Random Forest for feature selection and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification, the model aims to assist in early detection and better management of heart disease.
With heart disease being a leading cause of death globally, this project highlights how data-driven approaches can empower healthcare providers with predictive insights, making diagnoses faster and more accurate.

FEATURES
Random Forest for Feature Importance: Identifies the most significant features contributing to heart disease prediction.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Prediction: Provides a robust classification model with high accuracy.
Interactive Visualizations: Includes feature importance plots to help understand the model's decision-making process.
Scalable Design: Can be extended to include more features or integrated with real-world applications.
